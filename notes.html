    <h3 class="margin-top">Introduction</h3>
    <p>The purpose of this page is to document my own learning from different sources. Being someone who constantly likes learn and to refine my understanding of things, I sometimes find myself going back to things I have already read. Othertimes, I
      come across the things I have already learned but presented in a new perspective in a new source. This prompted me to create a knowledge base that remains constant and then I can add to it whenever I come to know something new.</p>

    <h3>Daylight</h3>

    <h5>Daylight Factor</h5>

    <p>A ratio of inside illuminance to outside illuminance.</p>
    <p>The following factors affect daylight factor;</p>
    <ul class="list-group">
      <li class="list-group-item">Building geometry</li>
      <li class="list-group-item">Surrounding obstructions</li>
      <li class="list-group-item">Optical surface properties</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The limitation of this metric is that it does not consider the following variables;</p>
    <ul class="list-group">
      <li class="list-group-item">facade orientation</li>
      <li class="list-group-item">seasons</li>
      <li class="list-group-item">time of the day</li>
      <li class="list-group-item">direct sun ingress</li>
      <li class="list-group-item">programmatic use</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The original intent of this metric was to assess whether the minimum light levels were achieved during the worst case scenario that is the overcast sky.</p>

    <p>It is obvious that this intent does not work for an equator facing building in a sunny
      climate. In such a climate, daylight factor will miss excessive daylight and therefore will not be able to address the issues of visual discomfort and overheating.</p>

    <h3>Thermal Comfort</h3>
    <p>The core human body temperature remains 37 degree celsius and the surface of human body is generally at 32 degrees celsius</p>
    <p>Human body has about 1.8m2 of surface</p>
    <p>It's always best to have cool ceilings and warm feet. This should be quite obvious.</p>
    <p>Operative temperature is the mean of MRT and DB</p>
    <p>The best thermal comfort strategy is to give the users control over their thermal environment. Also, if possible, provide more local comfort.</p>
    <ul class="list-group">
      <li class="list-group-item active">Effects of relative humidity</li>
      <li class="list-group-item">305 to 65% = Little effect</li>
      <li class="list-group-item">Less than 30% = Dry skin and muscous membrane</li>
      <li class="list-group-item">Greater than 65% = Restricted evaporation</li>
    </ul>

    <ul class="list-group">
      <li class="list-group-item active">Effects of Air velocity</li>
      <li class="list-group-item">les than 0.1 m/s = stuffy</li>
      <li class="list-group-item">0.2 to 0.5 m/s = Pleasant</li>
      <li class="list-group-item">0.5 to 1 m/s = awareness</li>
      <li class="list-group-item">1 to 1.5 m/s = drafty</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>LEED V4</h3>

    <p>The idea behind high and low illuminance threshold is to combine the metrics of daylight availability and glare in one set of thresholds. This is typically done so that architects don't have to worry about two metrics at the same time.</p>

    <p>LEED was first introduced in 2000</p>
    <p>43% of the LEED projects are outside of the USA</p>
    <h6>Vision</h4>
      <p>Buildings and communities will regenrate and sustain the health and vitality of all life within a generation</p>

      <h6>Mission</h4>
        <p>To transform the way buildings and communities are designed, built, and operated, enabling an environmentally and socially responsible, healthy, and prosperous environment that improves the quality of life.</p>

        <h6>Maintenance</h4>
          <p>GAs to earn 15 continuing education hours (3 LEED Specific hours) within 2 year</p>
          <p>APs to earn 30 continuing education hours (6 LEED Specific hours) within 2 year</p>

          <p>GBCI is a third party organization, that administers certifications and professional credentials within the framework of leed rating systems</p>
          <p>Leed certification program is developed by USGBC</p>

          <ul class="list-group">
            <li class="list-group-item">Certified 40-49</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">Silver 50-59</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">Gold 60-79</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">Platinum 80-more</li>
          </ul>

          <p>New construction and major renovation applies to high-rise buildings higher than 9 stories. The owner or tenant must occupy at least 50% of the leasable square footage.</p>

          <p>Core and shell is the only adaptation where the project can be pre-certified. This is an appropriate adaptation if more than 40% is unfinished at the time of certification.</p>

          <h3>Photovoltaic </h3>
          <p>It is important to think how PV is being fixed on the roof. A system not being fixed to the roof is eocnomical over a longer period</p>
